QEMU Test JeOS
==============

This is a simple build system that builds a super small environment that can be
used within qemu-test.  It uses a Linux kernel, uClibc and busybox to provide
the smallest possible guest with a usable shell.

The environment supports cross compilation such it is possible to build a JeOS
for any target that QEMU supports regardless of your host system.

Usage
-----

$ git submodule update --init
$ make ARCH=i486

Supporting New Architectures
----------------------------

In theory, you only need to create two files to support a new architecture:

 - configs/uClibc-$(ARCH).config
 - configs/linux-$(ARCH).config

You can create these files by using the following procedure:

        $ mkdir tmp && cd tmp
        $ make -C $(pwd)/../uClibc O=$(pwd) ARCH=$ARCH defconfig
        $ cp .config ../configs/uClibc-$ARCH.config
        $ diff -u ../configs/uClibc-$ARCH.config ../configs/uClibc-i486.config

In the last step, make sure to fixup any options that don't look like they're
architecture specific.  We require a few options to be set in uClibc that aren't
set by default.

The procedure to create a kernel .config is almost identical to the above except
that most architectures don't have a useful 'defconfig'.  You'll need to run
whatever form of defconfig is appropriate for that architecture.
