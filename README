QEMU Test JeOS
==============

This is a simple build system that builds a super small environment that can be
used within qemu-test.  It uses a Linux kernel, uClibc and busybox to provide
the smallest possible guest with a usable shell.

The environment supports cross compilation such it is possible to build a JeOS
for any target that QEMU supports regardless of your host system.

Usage
-----

$ git submodule update --init
$ make ARCH=i386
